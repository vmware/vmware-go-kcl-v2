# Usage Examples
This directory provides some basic examples of using the `vmware-go-kcl-v2`
package. When in doubt, you should always defer to the upstream AWS KCL
documentation, however these examples should get you started in the right
direction.

## Basic Example
The [basic] example is a direct translation of the offical
[sample_kclpy_app.py] example. The example takes a single positional
argument representing the path to a JSON configuration file. An
[example configuration] file is also included.

[basic]: ./basic
[example configuration]: ./basic/sample.json
[sample_kclpy_app.py]: https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client-python/blob/master/samples/sample_kclpy_app.py
