## Overview

VMware-Go-KCL-V2 is a native open-source Go library for Amazon Kinesis Data Stream (KDS) consumption. It allows developers
to program KDS consumers in lightweight Go language and still take advantage of the features presented by the native
KDS Java API libraries.

[vmware-go-kcl-v2](https://github.com/vmware/vmware-go-kcl-v2) is a VMWare originated open-source project for AWS Kinesis
Client Library in Go. Within VMware, we have seen adoption in vSecureState and Carbon Black. In addition, Carbon Black
has contributed to the vmware-go-kcl codebase and heavily used it in the product. Besides,
[vmware-go-kcl-v2](https://github.com/vmware/vmware-go-kcl-v2) has got
[recognition](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adityakrish_vmware-go-kcl-a-native-open-source-go-programming-activity-6810626798133616640-B6W8/),
and [contributions](https://github.com/vmware/vmware-go-kcl-v2/graphs/contributors) from the industry.

`vmware-go-kcl-v2` is the v2 version of VMWare KCL for the Go programming language by utilizing [AWS Go SDK V2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2).
